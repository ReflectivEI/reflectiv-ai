DIAGNOSIS: Widget Working Correctly - Backend CORS Configuration Needed
================================================================================

GOOD NEWS:
- ✅ Banner/button fix is working correctly
- ✅ Widget detects backend is unavailable
- ✅ Banner shows: "Backend unavailable. Trying again…"
- ✅ SEND button is disabled
- ✅ Health check polling is running

ACTUAL ISSUE:
The backend Cloudflare Worker is blocking requests due to CORS policy.

Console error shows:
"Access to fetch at 'https://my-chat-agent-v2.tonyabdelmalak.workers.dev/chat' 
from origin 'https://reflectivei.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

ROOT CAUSE:
The worker's CORS_ORIGINS environment variable needs to include the GitHub Pages
origin: https://reflectivei.github.io

SOLUTION:
Configure the Cloudflare Worker environment variable:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select worker: my-chat-agent-v2
3. Settings → Variables
4. Add/Update:
   Name: CORS_ORIGINS
   Value: https://reflectivei.github.io

5. Save and wait ~30 seconds for redeployment

VERIFICATION:
After CORS is configured:
1. Health check will pass
2. Banner will disappear
3. SEND button will be enabled
4. Messages will send successfully

WIDGET STATUS: ✅ Working as designed - correctly detecting backend issues
BACKEND STATUS: ❌ Needs CORS configuration
