{"reply":"Challenge: The oncologist may not be considering biomarker-driven subsets for ADC pathways due to lack of awareness about the importance of AOS/APFS in defining these subsets.\n\nRep Approach:\n• Discuss the significance of assessing tumor antigen expression and patient-specific factors (AOS/APFS) to identify biomarker-driven subsets for ADC pathways, as recommended for optimal ADC treatment planning [ONC-ADC-MECHANISMS-003].\n• Highlight the potential for improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity by tailoring ADC therapy to specific patient populations, as indicated in the FDA label for ADCs [ONC-ADC-TOXICITY-004].\n• Emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment of patient-specific factors to ensure safe and effective ADC treatment, per the FDA label and NCCN guidelines [ONC-ADC-TOXICITY-004].\n\nImpact: By emphasizing the importance of AOS/APFS in defining biomarker-driven subsets for ADC pathways, the oncologist will be more likely to incorporate these factors into treatment planning, leading to improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.\n\nSuggested Phrasing: \"To optimize ADC treatment planning, I recommend we discuss how to assess tumor antigen expression and patient-specific factors to identify biomarker-driven subsets, and consider ongoing monitoring to ensure safe and effective treatment.\"\n\n<coach>{\"scores\":{\"empathy\":4,\"clarity\":5,\"compliance\":4,\"discovery\":4,\"objection_handling\":4,\"confidence\":5,\"active_listening\":5,\"adaptability\":4,\"action_insight\":5,\"resilience\":4},\"rationales\":{\"empathy\":\"Acknowledge the oncologist's concerns and show understanding of their perspective.\",\"clarity\":\"Clearly explain the importance of AOS/APFS in defining biomarker-driven subsets.\",\"compliance\":\"Emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment of patient-specific factors.\",\"discovery\":\"Highlight the potential for improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.\",\"objection_handling\":\"Address any concerns the oncologist may have about incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning.\",\"confidence\":\"Confidently present the benefits of AOS/APFS in ADC treatment planning.\",\"active_listening\":\"Listen attentively to the oncologist's questions and concerns.\",\"adaptability\":\"Be flexible and willing to adjust the approach as needed.\",\"action_insight\":\"Clearly explain the steps needed to incorporate AOS/APFS into treatment planning.\",\"resilience\":\"Maintain a positive and professional demeanor despite any obstacles or challenges.\"},\"tips\":[\"Tip 1: Use clear and concise language when explaining AOS/APFS and its importance in ADC treatment planning.\",\"Tip 2: Emphasize the potential benefits of incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning, such as improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.\",\"Tip 3: Be prepared to address any concerns the oncologist may have about incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning.\"],\"rubric_version\":\"v2.0\"}</coach>","coach":{"scores":{"empathy":4,"clarity":5,"compliance":4,"discovery":4,"objection_handling":4,"confidence":5,"active_listening":5,"adaptability":4,"action_insight":5,"resilience":4},"rationales":{"empathy":"Acknowledge the oncologist's concerns and show understanding of their perspective.","clarity":"Clearly explain the importance of AOS/APFS in defining biomarker-driven subsets.","compliance":"Emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and assessment of patient-specific factors.","discovery":"Highlight the potential for improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.","objection_handling":"Address any concerns the oncologist may have about incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning.","confidence":"Confidently present the benefits of AOS/APFS in ADC treatment planning.","active_listening":"Listen attentively to the oncologist's questions and concerns.","adaptability":"Be flexible and willing to adjust the approach as needed.","action_insight":"Clearly explain the steps needed to incorporate AOS/APFS into treatment planning.","resilience":"Maintain a positive and professional demeanor despite any obstacles or challenges."},"tips":["Tip 1: Use clear and concise language when explaining AOS/APFS and its importance in ADC treatment planning.","Tip 2: Emphasize the potential benefits of incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning, such as improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.","Tip 3: Be prepared to address any concerns the oncologist may have about incorporating AOS/APFS into treatment planning."],"rubric_version":"v2.0"},"plan":{"id":"4f070692800229f7"}}
