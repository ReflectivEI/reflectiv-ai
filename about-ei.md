## Emotional Assessment Protocols

Emotional intelligence (EI) training emphasises an evidence‑based, learner‑centred approach. Guidelines from the Emotional Intelligence Consortium recommend that organisations and individuals take a structured, multi‑step approach: assess the organisation’s needs and the individual’s competencies, deliver feedback in a clear and supportive way, link learning goals to personal values, encourage participation, and ensure learners set clear goals and direct their own learning【671796481379701†L93-L106】【671796481379701†L110-L146】.

In practical terms, an EI assessment should:

- **Use multiple sources and methods** to evaluate key competencies【671796481379701†L93-L102】.
- **Provide strengths and development areas in a safe environment**【671796481379701†L103-L107】.
- **Motivate learners by aligning learning objectives with personal values and allowing choice**【671796481379701†L110-L124】.
- **Encourage self‑directed learning and goal setting**【671796481379701†L138-L146】.

These principles underpin ReflectivEI’s **Assess → Personalize → Practice → Reflect** framework. The platform helps users evaluate their communication style, tailor their approach to different healthcare provider personas, practise interactions, and reflect on feedback.

## Evidence‑Based HIV Medication Information

### Descovy

Descovy is a fixed‑dose tablet containing emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. According to the prescribing information, Descovy is indicated **in combination with other antiretroviral agents** to treat HIV‑1 infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg and in certain paediatric patients【304534011731479†L40-L52】. It is also indicated for **pre‑exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)** to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV‑1 infection in at‑risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg【304534011731479†L53-L58】. The PrEP indication excludes individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex because the effectiveness of Descovy in this population has not been evaluated【304534011731479†L59-L62】. For PrEP, the recommended dosage is one 200 mg/25 mg tablet once daily with or without food【304534011731479†L76-L88】. Descovy is contraindicated for PrEP in individuals with unknown or positive HIV‑1 status【304534011731479†L98-L100】 and is not recommended in people with severe renal impairment【304534011731479†L87-L92】. Common adverse reactions include nausea (≥10%) in people with HIV‑1 and diarrhea (≥5%) in adults without HIV‑1【304534011731479†L123-L130】.

### Biktarvy

Biktarvy combines bictegravir (an integrase strand transfer inhibitor) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. The highlights of prescribing information state that Biktarvy is a **complete regimen** for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection in adults and paediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg【904436148651425†L27-L46】. It can be used in people with no antiretroviral treatment history or in those replacing their current regimen if they are virologically suppressed and have no known substitutions associated with resistance【904436148651425†L27-L46】. The recommended adult dosage is one tablet containing 50 mg bictegravir, 200 mg emtricitabine and 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide taken once daily with or without food【904436148651425†L49-L69】. Biktarvy is contraindicated with certain medications such as dofetilide and rifampin【904436148651425†L81-L84】 and is not recommended in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment【904436148651425†L70-L75】. Common adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea and headache【904436148651425†L97-L100】.

### Cabenuva

Cabenuva is a long‑acting injectable regimen co‑packaging cabotegravir (an integrase inhibitor) and rilpivirine (a non‑nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). It is indicated as a complete regimen to treat HIV‑1 infection in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older who weigh at least 35 kg and are **virologically suppressed** (HIV‑1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure【797898087128089†L15-L25】. The product replaces the current oral regimen; dosing can be monthly or every two months following an optional oral lead‑in period【797898087128089†L39-L51】. Cabenuva is administered by gluteal intramuscular injection and comes in kits with fixed doses of cabotegravir and rilpivirine【797898087128089†L39-L62】. It is contraindicated in people with previous hypersensitivity to either component or those taking drugs that significantly reduce cabotegravir or rilpivirine concentrations【797898087128089†L63-L70】. Warnings and precautions include serious hypersensitivity reactions, post‑injection reactions, hepatotoxicity and depressive disorders【797898087128089†L73-L90】. Common adverse reactions (≥2%) include injection site reactions, fever, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness and rash【797898087128089†L100-L105】.
