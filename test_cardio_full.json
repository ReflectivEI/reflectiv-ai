{"reply":"Challenge: The HCP is concerned about the optimal titration timelines for heart failure medications in their cardiology practice.\n\nRep Approach:\n• Discuss the importance of initiating beta-blockers at a low dose and titrating to target or maximum tolerated dose over weeks, as recommended for stable HFrEF patients [CV-BETA-BLOCKER-007].\n• Highlight the benefits of early initiation of GDMT, including ARNI, beta-blockers, SGLT2i, and statins, within 48-72 hours post-MI, to improve adherence and outcomes [CV-POST-MI-TRANSITION-008].\n• Emphasize the need for careful monitoring of potassium and renal function when adding MRAs, such as spironolactone, to ACE-I and beta-blockers, to ensure safe prescribing practices [CV-MRA-SPIRONOLACTONE-006].\n\nImpact: By emphasizing the importance of gradual beta-blocker titration, early initiation of GDMT post-MI, and careful monitoring of potassium and renal function, the HCP will be more likely to optimize heart failure medication titration timelines and improve patient outcomes.\n\nSuggested Phrasing: \"To ensure we're providing the best possible care for our heart failure patients, I recommend we focus on gradual beta-blocker titration, early initiation of GDMT post-MI, and careful monitoring of potassium and renal function when adding MRAs.\"\n\n<coach>{\"scores\":{\"empathy\":4,\"clarity\":5,\"compliance\":4,\"discovery\":3,\"objection_handling\":4,\"confidence\":5,\"active_listening\":4,\"adaptability\":4,\"action_insight\":5,\"resilience\":4},\"rationales\":{\"empathy\":\"Acknowledge
