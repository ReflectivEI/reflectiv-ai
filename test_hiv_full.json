{"reply":"Challenge: The HCP may be uncertain about effective adherence support strategies for at-risk HIV patients, potentially impacting treatment outcomes.\n\nRep Approach:\n• Discuss the importance of long-acting regimens, such as Apretude (cabotegravir long-acting injectable), for improving adherence in patients facing daily pill burden challenges, as indicated for PrEP [HIV-PREP-APRETUDE-004].\n• Highlight the benefits of sustained viral suppression, requiring >95% adherence to ART, and how long-acting regimens may support this goal, as emphasized in the CDC PrEP Guidelines 2024 [HIV-ADHERENCE-008].\n• Emphasize the need for regular monitoring of renal function and urinalysis before and during PrEP, considering eGFR thresholds, to ensure safe prescribing practices and minimize potential adherence barriers [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].\n\nImpact: By exploring long-acting regimens and emphasizing the importance of sustained viral suppression, the HCP will be more likely to implement effective adherence support strategies for at-risk HIV patients.\n\nSuggested Phrasing: \"Considering the challenges of daily pill burden, I recommend we discuss the benefits of long-acting regimens, such as Apretude, for improving adherence and supporting sustained viral suppression in our at-risk HIV patients.\"\n\n<coach>{\"scores\":{\"empathy\":4,\"clarity\":5,\"compliance\":4,\"discovery\":5,\"objection_handling\":4,\"confidence\":5,\"active_listening\":5,\"adaptability\":4,\"action_insight\":5,\"resilience\":4},\"rationales\":{\"empathy\":\"Acknowledge the HCP's uncertainty and show understanding.\",\"clarity\":\"Clearly explain the benefits of long-acting regimens.\",\"compliance\":\"Emphasize the importance of adherence support.\",\"discovery\":\"Explore the HCP's current practices and identify areas for improvement.\",\"objection_handling\":\"Address potential concerns about long-acting regimens.\",\"confidence\":\"Confidently present the benefits of long-acting regimens.\",\"active_listening\":\"Listen attentively to the HCP's concerns and questions.\",\"adaptability\":\"Be flexible and open to adjusting the approach as needed.\",\"action_insight\":\"Identify specific actions the HCP can take to improve adherence support.\",\"resilience\":\"Maintain a positive and supportive tone despite potential resistance.\"},\"tips\":[\"Tip 1: Use clear and concise language when discussing adherence support strategies.\",\"Tip 2: Emphasize the benefits of long-acting regimens for improving adherence.\",\"Tip 3: Regularly monitor renal function and urinalysis to ensure safe prescribing practices.\"],\"rubric_version\":\"v2.0\"}</coach>","coach":{"scores":{"empathy":4,"clarity":5,"compliance":4,"discovery":5,"objection_handling":4,"confidence":5,"active_listening":5,"adaptability":4,"action_insight":5,"resilience":4},"rationales":{"empathy":"Acknowledge the HCP's uncertainty and show understanding.","clarity":"Clearly explain the benefits of long-acting regimens.","compliance":"Emphasize the importance of adherence support.","discovery":"Explore the HCP's current practices and identify areas for improvement.","objection_handling":"Address potential concerns about long-acting regimens.","confidence":"Confidently present the benefits of long-acting regimens.","active_listening":"Listen attentively to the HCP's concerns and questions.","adaptability":"Be flexible and open to adjusting the approach as needed.","action_insight":"Identify specific actions the HCP can take to improve adherence support.","resilience":"Maintain a positive and supportive tone despite potential resistance."},"tips":["Tip 1: Use clear and concise language when discussing adherence support strategies.","Tip 2: Emphasize the benefits of long-acting regimens for improving adherence.","Tip 3: Regularly monitor renal function and urinalysis to ensure safe prescribing practices."],"rubric_version":"v2.0"},"plan":{"id":"8aa4d1d981cb4be4"}}
