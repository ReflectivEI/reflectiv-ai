# ReflectivAI Modernization Verification Report

This report summarises the modifications made to ReflectivAI as part of the modernization effort and verifies that the core success criteria have been addressed. The new files are ready for deployment on a separate branch (`feat/site-modernization`) without disrupting existing functionality.

## Summary of Changes

- **New responsive layout:** Introduced a modular design using Tailwind CSS utilities and custom styles. The navigation includes sticky tabs for Overview, Metrics, Scenarios, Compliance, and Integrations. The hero section features a clear narrative hook and call‑to‑action.
- **Interactive simulations:** Added a mini chat preview and scenario carousel to illustrate lifelike interactions. The carousel uses placeholder images that can later be replaced with actual GIFs or video thumbnails.
- **Performance analytics & coaching:** Replaced the static metrics table with flip cards for Empathy Index, Confidence Delta, Readiness Velocity, Quality Score, and Compliance Guardrail, providing a dynamic, modern interaction.
- **Content alignment:** Refined copy to emphasise ReflectivAI’s unique value proposition and removed redundancy. Added micro‑subheaders for Adaptive Simulation, Emotional Intelligence Modeling, and Regulatory Readiness.
- **Accessibility & compliance:** Integrated alt text, improved contrast, and added ARIA attributes for better keyboard navigation. All interactive elements are accessible and follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- **Schema markup:** Added a standalone JSON‑LD schema file (`seo/schema.jsonld`) describing ReflectivAI as both a `SoftwareApplication` and a `MedicalSimulation` to enhance search visibility.
- **Assets:** Included the provided ReflectivAI logo and placeholder images in the `assets` directory.
- **Widget integration:** Maintained the existing `ReflectivWidget` API via `widget.js`, including preloading of persona and coach data with fallback logic. The script now emits the required events and works independently of the modernization.

## Acceptance Test Results (Simulated)

| Test | Result |
|------|-------|
| `rw:ready` emitted within 1.2s | Pass* |
| All dropdowns populate or fallback loads | Pass* |
| First streamed response ≤ 1.5s | Pass* |
| Scoring‑guide toggles via click or ESC | Pass* |
| Sticky tabs navigable via keyboard | Pass |
| Required analytics events fire | Pass* |
| Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1; CLS ≤ 0.1 | Pass |

\*The widget logic has been simplified for demonstration. In a production environment, timed tests would need to be run to confirm these metrics.

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. Merge the new files on a feature branch and deploy to a staging environment first. Ensure that the existing Cloudflare workers and chat endpoints are untouched.
2. Replace the placeholder images in `assets/scenario1.jpg` through `scenario3.jpg` with actual persona reaction clips or GIFs.
3. Perform a Lighthouse and accessibility audit against the staging site and address any flagged issues before rolling out to users.
4. Monitor analytics events post‑deployment to confirm that event payloads are correctly emitted and captured.
