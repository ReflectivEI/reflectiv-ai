Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach:
• Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) and urinalysis before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].
• Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].
• Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to adhere to the recommended monitoring schedule and adjust PrEP dosing as needed to ensure patient safety.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label."

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By monitoring renal function regularly, the HCP will be able to identify potential renal issues early and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective treatment for patients.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to prevent renal impairment and ensure the continued safety of PrEP, as indicated in the FDA label for Descovy [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the continued safety of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue treatment if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency of renal function monitoring for PrEP patients.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min to prevent renal impairment, as per the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and adjust treatment as needed if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Emphasize the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Discuss the potential for dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to ensure patient safety and optimal treatment outcomes [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adapt treatment plans as needed for patients with renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we establish a regular monitoring schedule for renal function, ideally every 3-6 months, and adjust treatment plans as needed based on eGFR thresholds. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment to ensure safe PrEP prescribing, as indicated in the guidelines to monitor every 3-6 months during treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for ongoing monitoring to adjust or discontinue PrEP if eGFR thresholds are not met, as recommended for patients with renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering individual patient factors, such as comorbidities and medication regimens, when determining the frequency of renal function monitoring [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By clarifying the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize ongoing assessment and adjust PrEP prescribing accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust or discontinue PrEP if eGFR thresholds are not met. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue PrEP if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may be uncertain about the frequency of renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment, as indicated in the guidelines, to monitor for potential kidney issues during PrEP treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment to ensure safe prescribing practices and adjust the treatment plan as necessary [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR is below 50 mL/min to prevent potential kidney damage [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By regularly monitoring renal function, the HCP will be able to identify potential kidney issues early and adjust the treatment plan to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR is below 50 mL/min. "
