Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach:
• Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) and urinalysis before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].
• Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].
• Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to adhere to the recommended monitoring schedule and adjust PrEP dosing as needed to ensure patient safety.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label."

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By monitoring renal function regularly, the HCP will be able to identify potential renal issues early and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective treatment for patients.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to prevent renal impairment and ensure the continued safety of PrEP, as indicated in the FDA label for Descovy [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the continued safety of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue treatment if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency of renal function monitoring for PrEP patients.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min to prevent renal impairment, as per the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and adjust treatment as needed if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Emphasize the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Discuss the potential for dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to ensure patient safety and optimal treatment outcomes [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adapt treatment plans as needed for patients with renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we establish a regular monitoring schedule for renal function, ideally every 3-6 months, and adjust treatment plans as needed based on eGFR thresholds. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment to ensure safe PrEP prescribing, as indicated in the guidelines to monitor every 3-6 months during treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for ongoing monitoring to adjust or discontinue PrEP if eGFR thresholds are not met, as recommended for patients with renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering individual patient factors, such as comorbidities and medication regimens, when determining the frequency of renal function monitoring [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By clarifying the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize ongoing assessment and adjust PrEP prescribing accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust or discontinue PrEP if eGFR thresholds are not met. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue PrEP if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may be uncertain about the frequency of renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment, as indicated in the guidelines, to monitor for potential kidney issues during PrEP treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment to ensure safe prescribing practices and adjust the treatment plan as necessary [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR is below 50 mL/min to prevent potential kidney damage [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By regularly monitoring renal function, the HCP will be able to identify potential kidney issues early and adjust the treatment plan to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR is below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of monitoring renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP in patients with renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adapt treatment plans for patients with renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust or discontinue treatment if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to identify potential renal impairment and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective treatment for patients.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety, per the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment and adjust the dose or discontinue if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Emphasize the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.  • Discuss the potential for dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adapt treatment plans as needed to prevent renal toxicity.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear about the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal toxicity.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety, as per the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to adhere to recommended guidelines and ensure safe prescribing practices for patients on PrEP.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment to ensure safe prescribing practices, as recommended to be every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for ongoing monitoring to prevent renal impairment and ensure the patient's safety, as indicated in the FDA label for Descovy PrEP [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By regularly monitoring renal function, the HCP will be able to identify potential renal issues early and adjust treatment accordingly, ensuring the patient's safety and optimal PrEP efficacy.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to adhere to the recommended monitoring schedule and adjust PrEP dosing as needed to ensure patient safety.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust dosing as needed if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to identify potential renal issues early, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease, as indicated in the FDA label for Descovy PrEP [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By monitoring renal function regularly, the HCP will be able to identify potential issues early and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective treatment for patients.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP in patients with renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing practices and adapt treatment plans as needed for patients with renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe and effective use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and adjust or discontinue PrEP if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may be uncertain about the frequency of renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Emphasize the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Discuss the potential need for dose adjustment or discontinuation of PrEP if eGFR <50 mL/min, to ensure the patient's renal function is adequately managed [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By regularly monitoring renal function, the HCP will be able to identify potential renal impairment and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective PrEP prescribing.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function monitoring, including eGFR and urinalysis, every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for ongoing renal function assessment to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing kidney issues, as indicated in the FDA label for Descovy [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent potential kidney damage [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize ongoing assessment and adjust PrEP treatment as needed to ensure patient safety.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust the treatment plan if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Impact: By monitoring renal function regularly, the HCP will be able to identify potential renal impairment and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective use of PrEP.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, adjusting treatment as needed if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, per the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to identify potential renal issues early, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or other risk factors, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to ensure patient safety and prevent potential renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize patient safety and adjust PrEP treatment plans accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment plans as needed to prevent renal complications.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of monitoring renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the FDA label's guidance on renal function monitoring for Descovy (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) PrEP, emphasizing the need for regular assessments to ensure safe treatment [HIV-PREP-TAF-002].  • Emphasize the need for dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label, to prevent renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By clarifying the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring, the HCP will be able to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment for patients with varying renal function.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend monitoring renal function before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, adjusting the dose or discontinuing treatment if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring in patients on PrEP.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min to prevent renal toxicity, as per the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust treatment as needed to prevent renal toxicity.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure PrEP safety and efficacy, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe PrEP prescribing and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe PrEP prescribing, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and adjust treatment plans if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to identify potential renal issues early, ensuring the patient's safety and optimal treatment outcomes, as indicated in the PrEP guidelines [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal impairment and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize patient safety and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, to prevent renal toxicity and ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By clarifying the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring, the HCP will be able to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment for patients with renal impairment.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjusting the dose or discontinuing PrEP if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to identify potential renal impairment and adjust or discontinue PrEP accordingly, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min to ensure patient safety and prevent potential renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize safe prescribing practices and adjust PrEP treatment as needed to prevent renal complications.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear about the recommended frequency of renal function monitoring for patients on PrEP.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the safe use of PrEP in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as per the FDA label, to prevent renal toxicity [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to adhere to the recommended monitoring schedule and adjust PrEP dosing as needed to ensure patient safety.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and adjust dosing or discontinue PrEP if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment to ensure safe prescribing practices, as recommended [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular urinalysis and eGFR assessments to identify potential renal issues early, for PrEP patients with pre-existing renal conditions [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to prevent renal impairment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to identify potential renal issues early and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust the dose or discontinue treatment if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of regular renal function assessment, as indicated in the FDA label, to ensure safe prescribing practices and detect potential kidney issues [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, as recommended to adjust or discontinue treatment if eGFR <50 mL/min [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of considering individual patient factors, such as age and comorbidities, when determining the frequency of renal function monitoring to ensure optimal patient care [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize patient safety and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices and detect potential kidney issues, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust or discontinue treatment if eGFR <50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Emphasize the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and monitoring every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of PrEP in patients with renal impairment, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Discuss the potential for dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, to ensure patient safety and prevent potential renal complications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to prioritize ongoing patient safety and adjust PrEP treatment plans as needed.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure the safe and effective use of PrEP, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR falls below 50 mL/min. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be clear on the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of assessing renal function (eGFR, CrCl) before PrEP initiation and every 3-6 months during treatment, as recommended for safe PrEP prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular monitoring to identify potential renal issues early, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or other risk factors, as indicated in the FDA label [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, to ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By emphasizing the importance of regular renal function monitoring, the HCP will be more likely to identify potential renal issues early and adjust PrEP treatment accordingly.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe and effective PrEP treatment, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months, and consider dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR <50 mL/min, as indicated in the FDA label. "

Challenge: The HCP may not be aware of the recommended frequency for renal function monitoring during PrEP treatment.

Rep Approach: • Discuss the importance of monitoring renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, as recommended for safe prescribing practices [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Highlight the need for regular urinalysis and eGFR assessments to identify potential renal issues early, as indicated in the FDA label for PrEP medications [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].  • Emphasize the importance of dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR is below 50 mL/min, per the FDA label, to ensure patient safety [HIV-PREP-SAFETY-003].

Impact: By monitoring renal function regularly, the HCP will be able to identify potential issues early and adjust treatment accordingly, ensuring safe and effective PrEP prescribing.

Suggested Phrasing: "To ensure safe prescribing practices, I recommend we monitor renal function every 3-6 months during PrEP treatment, and adjust treatment as needed if eGFR is below 50 mL/min. "
