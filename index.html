        <h2>Ethics, Privacy &amp; Governance</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          ReflectivAI is built for life‑sciences training. We avoid Protected
          Health Information (PHI) by default and apply strict safeguards when
          customers choose to integrate real data.
        </p>
        <h3>Data privacy &amp; security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PHI is off by default; training uses synthetic or de‑identified data.</li>
          <li>When a customer enables PHI, we require a signed data‑processing
            agreement and a HIPAA business associate agreement. Data is encrypted
            in transit and at rest, access is role‑based, audit logs are
            retained and data is purged on expiration<span class="footnote-ref">[1]</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Vendor risk management: we vet sub‑processors for equivalent
            safeguards and conduct annual security reviews with a right‑to‑audit
            clause.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Informed consent</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If real patient data is used to power enablement, customers must
            obtain explicit, documented consent distinct from clinical consent and
            provide a clear opt‑out option.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Algorithmic bias &amp; fairness</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We conduct pre‑deployment bias testing on representative datasets and
            repeat tests periodically.</li>
          <li>We monitor for disparate performance across specialties, geographies
            and demographic contexts and publish remediation steps.</li>
          <li>Sales targeting guardrails prohibit using non‑clinical demographic
            proxies that could drive inequity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Transparency &amp; explainability</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In‑product recommendations include reason codes.</li>
          <li>We publish model cards detailing data sources, limitations and
            update cadence.</li>
          <li>AI‑generated content is clearly labeled throughout training materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Human oversight &amp; accountability</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Human reviewers curate scenario content and feedback rubrics.</li>
          <li>Escalation paths exist for model errors; responsibilities are
            defined between client, platform and vendors.</li>
          <li>All scenario versions and message libraries are versioned for MLR
            traceability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Doctor‑patient relationship</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Training is designed to support, not manipulate, HCP judgement.</li>
          <li>Off‑label promotion is prohibited and risky language is flagged.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Compliance anchors</h3>
        <p>
          We align our program with recognized standards and guidelines:
          <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html">HIPAA Privacy Rule</a>,

      <div class="section-inner">
        <h2>Why AI Sales Enablement Works</h2>
        <ul class="evidence-list">
          <li>
            <strong>AI adoption is accelerating:</strong> A May&nbsp;2025 survey of
            107 life‑sciences commercial leaders found that over 80% of
            organizations have moved beyond pilots, more than one‑third are
            “AI Advanced,” and nearly half dedicate more than 20% of their
            commercial budgets to AI. Leaders report 58% achieving 2× ROI and
            7% seeing 3× or more<span class="footnote-ref">[8]</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Value creation is substantial:</strong> McKinsey &amp; Company
            estimates that AI innovations could unlock US$8–16 billion in annual
            commercial value and generate a projected 10–15% gain in field team
            productivity across life‑sciences organizations<span class="footnote-ref">[9]</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meeting HCP needs:</strong> A 2024 pan‑European survey of HCPs
            revealed that 52% seek more clinical data, 67% expect more disease
            awareness content and 42% cite lack of contact with medical science
            liaisons as a barrier to value‑based engagement<span class="footnote-ref">[10]</span>. AI‑powered
            enablement allows reps to deliver tailored, data‑rich conversations
            that address these needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixing inefficiencies:</strong> Pharmaceutical companies
            collectively invest over US$137 billion annually in sales and
            marketing but still face major inefficiencies due to high costs,
            access challenges and poor CRM utilization<span class="footnote-ref">[11]</span>. AI and advanced
            analytics help teams allocate resources more effectively and focus on
            the right opportunities.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What sets ReflectivAI apart?</h3>
          <p>
            ReflectivAI combines emotionally intelligent feedback with
            life‑sciences compliance guardrails. Our simulations respond to
            tone, empathy and clarity while adhering to regulatory rules.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does it replace human coaching?</h3>
          <p>
            No. ReflectivAI augments managers by providing scalable practice and
            analytics. Human coaches remain essential to interpret data,
            reinforce skills and personalize development plans.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you handle PHI?</h3>
          <p>
            PHI usage is off by default. When enabled, we operate under HIPAA
            controls: minimum‑necessary scope, encryption in transit and at rest,
            audit logging and a signed business associate agreement<span class="footnote-ref">[1]</span>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is it customizable by disease state and region?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Modules, objections and labeling are aligned to your specific
            therapeutic areas and geographic regulations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can it integrate with LMS/CRM?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. We offer export packs and APIs for Salesforce, Veeva and
            popular learning management systems.
