            <h2>Evidence‚ÄëBased Design</h2>
            <p>Reflectiv is built on scientific research demonstrating the power of social and emotional learning and emerging technologies.</p>
            <ul class="evidence-list">
                <li>Social and emotional learning (SEL) teaches emotional management, resilience and relationship skills and is linked to positive outcomes such as improved emotional intelligence, reduced distress and enhanced academic performance„Äê576488791497994‚Ä†L76-L124„Äë.</li>
                <li>During the 2023‚Äë24 school year, 63% of U.S. public schools implemented SEL curricula, and 72% of those schools reported moderate to high effectiveness in improving student outcomes„Äê576488791497994‚Ä†L105-L119„Äë.</li>
                <li>Game‚Äëbased SEL interventions like Brain Agents demonstrate that trauma‚Äëinformed digital experiences can enhance resilience and emotional intelligence among youth exposed to adversity„Äê875479274686722‚Ä†L301-L305„Äë. Video games integrated with SEL content help students regulate emotions, develop empathy and improve mental health„Äê875479274686722‚Ä†L335-L368„Äë.</li>
                <li>Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that plan, reason and act with minimal human oversight„Äê232012286808677‚Ä†L116-L136„Äë. Integrating agentic AI into Reflectiv means your personalized journey evolves intelligently with your progress and context.</li>
                <li>AI companions are increasingly common: a 2025 report found that 72% of teens have used AI chatbots for companionship and 33% describe having friendships with them„Äê999570471240853‚Ä†L40-L44„Äë. Reflectiv teaches self‚Äëawareness and boundaries in digital relationships.</li>
                <li>AI literacy matters: experts note that while AI agents can support learning, they cannot fully replicate human connection. Children should be taught to understand the limitations of AI and to critically evaluate AI‚Äëgenerated content„Äê497907481029989‚Ä†L292-L320„Äë. Reflectiv integrates AI literacy tools so youth can engage safely and ethically with agentic AI.</li>
